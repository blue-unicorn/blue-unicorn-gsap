## Features

- Create animations using plain HTML or JSON
- Zero config

## Why use BlueUnicorn?

- Build animations without thinking about specific frameworks

## Setup

### Setup for use in the browser
Include this script
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/blue-unicorn/dist/blue-unicorn.min.js"></script>
```

### Setup for bundling (or if you want typings for TypeScript)

```bash
npm install blue-unicorn --save
```

## Getting Started
There are two different ways to build out animations with BlueUnicorn.  The most straightforward way is writing it as HTML before the page loads

```html
<div id="box1">BOX 1</div>

<layer name="box-animations" state="hidden-left">
    <state name="hidden-left">
        <target ref="#box1" opacity="0" x="-50px" />
    </state>
    <state name="reset">
        <target ref="#box1" opacity="1" x="0" />
    </state>
    <curve state-1="hidden-left" state-2="reset" easing="ease-out" duration="250" />
</layer>
```

Layers contain related groups of objects.  Each layer has states and curves.
States contain the targets they modify and curves define how to get from one state to another.

In the example, we have defined a layer named "box-animations" which will start in the "hidden-left" state. The layer contains two states, "hidden-left" and "reset".  Each state modifies the opacity and x property of "#box1".  The layer also contains a curve that states that when moving between those two states, the animation engine should take 250 milliseconds and move along an easing curve.

Here is an example of how to do the same thing using JavaScript:

```js
bu.loadJSON({
    'box-animations': {
        state: 'hidden-left',
        states: {
            'hidden-left': [{ ref: '#box1', opacity: '0', x: '-50px' }],
            reset: [{ ref: '#box1', opacity: '1', x: '0' }]
        },
        curves: [{ state1: 'hidden-left', state2: 'reset', easing: 'ease-out', duration: 250 }]
    }
})
```

To transition from one state to another:
```js
// to transition to reset
bu.transition('box-animations', 'reset');
```

To move directly to a state without a transition:
```js
// go direction to reset, do not pass GO, do not collect $200
bu.set('box-animations', 'reset');
```

Here are some other handy functions
```js
// resets all layers to their starting state
bu.reset();

// import new layers from an element
bu.importHTML(element);
```
